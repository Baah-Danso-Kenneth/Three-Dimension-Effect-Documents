Introductioon to three.js
************************

Definition;
***********
A high-level javascript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics in web browsers.

Purpose:
*******
Simplifies 3D graphics creation and animation(models, practice systems, lights, cameras) without low-level WebGL code knowledge.

GPU
- Designed to handle the demands of rendering 3D graphics.

- WebGL is a javascript API for rendering 3D graphics in a web browser using the GPU
- WebGL provides a language to talk to the GPU

Three.js is built on top of WebGL and implements it under the hood.

Three.js abstracts the complicated WebGL language into an easy-to-use javaScript API allowing for creative focus on projects.
